{"name":"Tweemap","tagline":"Create an interactive map of your twitter contacts","body":"# tweemap.py\r\n\r\nMap your twitter contacts!\r\n\r\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odhondt/tweemap/master/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\nThis python script creates an interactive map of your twitter contacts and classifies them into 3 categories: following, follower and mutual. You can drag and zoom the map. Clicking on a marker opens a pop-up with user names, locations and relationships. If several users are located in the same spot, the marker is a circle with a radius proportional to the number of contacts. The colors correspond to the relationship.\r\n\r\n**Limitation:** due to the rate restriction imposed by twitter's api, only up to 3000 contacts can be displayed in this version.\r\n\r\n* dependencies:\r\n  * tweepy\r\n  * pandas\r\n  * geopy\r\n  * folium\r\n\r\n* usage:\r\n  * change `cred_example.py` name into `cred.py`\r\n  * register for a twitter application at https://apps.twitter.com and fill in the variables with your credentials in `cred.py`\r\n  * launch `python tweemap.py`. This might take a while depending on how many contacts you have.\r\n  * In the end, a browser window with the map should open.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
